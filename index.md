[**Self reflection**]
 When I decided to get my computer science degree back in 2017. I knew it was going to be a very rewarding journey to say the least. The program as a whole has taught me everything that I need to be successful in this field. Capstone has been pushed to say interesting to be able to get through Unscathed and in one piece. I feel as if my knowledge in python database management has grown immensely throughout my program of study. It's really been a combination of the classes that catered to those particular skills as well as practicing and developing things on my own to really hone in the product that I present which is myself. Throughout the milestones for my computer science Capstone I think of these particular choices in mind for a test to show me weaknesses and things that I can improve on a daily basis whe, whether it be personally or. Professionally. The artifacts that I have chosen were to enhance a 3-D triangle with scenic movement using camera and lighting implement mentation. The next artifact displays my ability to use object oriented programming through the passenger classroom from Mako cruise ship application. The last and final artifact shows my ability to be able to use the database application mongo DB along with python to create an animal shelter application that intakes a variety of animals based upon the animals age animals birthdate the gender of the animal as well as different system features that help the in user manage the animals that come into the shelter for this application.
 
 
[**3D Triangle**]
**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**
The artifact that I’ve chosen to enhance is a 3d pyramid that I created in CS 330 computational graphics and visualization class. The artifact in question to me can be enhanced by adding a scenic element to the program by adding a scenic element via camera movement allowing the user to move about the 3D scene as well as lighting. The program was developed in the C++ language along with the use of OpenGL API.
**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your portfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**
I chose this artifact because I feel as if it demonstrates the software engineering and design portion needed to complete my final project and shows my ability to use APIs to develop within an environment and implement the necessary objectives and requirements. I selected this item because hi seen from the original code that it wouldn’t be overly difficult to implement movement into the 3-D scene that was already created as well as add different texturing and lighting features. and although I am not particularly familiar with the use of API, I think this is an excellent exercise to delve back into refamiliarizing myself with C++ and learning something new. This artifact was improved by completely revamping the code base along with adding as stated before a scenic element to the already coded 3-D triangle which includes lighting and camera movement.
 
**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates on your outcome- coverage plans?** 
	I do think I am meeting my planned enhancement objectives though I do understand to be able to truly fine-tune my final project, instructors' feedback is going to be integral in my enhancements; of course, there will be more to come. By the way off, updates on my outcome and enhancement plan overall.
**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**
In the process of enhancing the original artifact I had difficulties with implementing some of the library‘s one, in particular, was one of the math libraries that is needed to be able to code the vertices, as well as I, found myself taking more time on the enhancement than I originally anticipated it did prove yourself to be certainly a task but I managed to get it done. Some things I learned while doing this enhancement for the software engineering and design element of the final project were brushing up on C++ and learning how to use the OpenGL API all over again. Whilst taking the class Learning the API was definitely one of the biggest learning curves that I had to overcome and even now in writing this by I’m still pretty rusty but I think it was a great experience and I think that it’s going to be integral in improving my development skills overall that’s going to translate into my personal life as well as professional life.
